## PRE -EVENTS ACTIVITIES
    • Brainstorming on the ideas of the lamp
    • identifying the materials and tools to be used
    • Gathering up all the needed materials and tools and deciding how will the project take.
    • Testing the resistors and the battery to be used.
    • Prototyping the all project on the bread board .
    • Testing how it works.
    • Soldering the all circuit into the circuit board.
    • Preparing the casing out of 500ml water bottle made out of plastic’
    • cutting it into the design to its best to the community.
    • Retesting the resistors and the battery
    • changing all the design .
    • Removed the jump wire and connecting the strip wire casing it up
    • insulating the strip wire.
      

## PROCEDURES / STEPS


STEP 1
Before any procedure is started ensure that the ground is set and every tool/ equipment and materials needed are in place [available]to avoid inconveniences.

STEP 2
Measure and calculate resistor to make sure they are in the right sizes (Amps).

STEP 3
Prototype on the bread board and test if its working or in good shape (yes or no) if in good shape  transfer the exact procedure to the circuit and solder all connections correctly. if its not working check all connections again and correct then retest.
STEP 4
Test if it works then connect switch to the prototype and solder it.
NOTE; no jumper wires should be used in soldering.

STEP 5
Build your casing ( remember you can build any shape that suits your choice).
NOTE; Use box to design casing 
          ;Use seal tape to hold the casing in one shape

STEP 6
Use plastic bottle to create a seal to protect LED bulb.
Test it again after casing.
